- 🔧 20+ years in software engineering across enterprise and startup ecosystems
- 🧠 Builder of scalable .NET, React, and cloud-first applications and solutions
- ☁️ Strong with Azure, Docker, Terraform, and Kubernetes
- 📈 Experienced with system modernization, legacy migrations, and dev productivity tooling
